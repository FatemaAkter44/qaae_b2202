public class Array {
    //given an array with integers, return the indices of the two number that add up to a given target.

    //[1,3,7,9,2] target number 11. we need to find the index number of 9 and 2 which is [3,4]

    // veriyfy constraints:
    //are all number possitive?
    // are there any duplicates?
    //will there alwayes be a solution?
    //we may recive empty earry or with one value only
    // what to retuen if there is no solution
    // are there multiple pair add up to the terget?


//best case test case:
//[1,3,7,9,2] terget 11 index[0,1,2,3,4]


//figur out solution without code

//two ponter technique
//number to find = tergert -1
//number to find = tergert -3 ...

// white out solution in code
